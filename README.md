# leaflet-challenge 
### (under construction)

## Utilizes html, and Javascript with Leaflet to visualize an earthquake data set using the USCG URL to pull in JSON data.


* Creates a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
* Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger and darker in color.
* Includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
* Creates a legend that will provide context for the map data.
